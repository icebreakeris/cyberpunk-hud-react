# Cyberpunk's hud made with React

Was bored so had a quick attempt at recreating some of the cyberpunk's hud

Its not functional at all, the visibility can be horrible with different backgrounds and is not mobile friendly at all. But it looks cool!

also this is not actually in game or anything, just didn't have any backgrounds so I used some screenshots from gta
